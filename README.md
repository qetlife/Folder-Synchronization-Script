# Veeam-Software

This is my take on the Synchronization Test for Veeam-Software.

The software is simple, using 5 internal libraries: os, shutil, logging, threading, argparse. 
Also the program uses 1 external library: schedule. (pip install schedule) is required if the library isn't already installed.
